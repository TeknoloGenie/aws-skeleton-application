## 🚀 Migration Guide

### For Administrators
1. Ensure your user account is added to the `admins` Cognito group
2. Navigate to `/admin` in any frontend application
3. Configure system settings in the App Configuration tab
4. Monitor user activity in the Analytics Dashboard
5. Manage data through the Data Management interface

### For Developers
1. Follow model management rules when creating new models
2. Update all three admin dashboard components for new models
3. Use migration scripts when refactoring component names
4. Implement mandatory analytics tracking in all components

### For System Operators
1. Configure log retention and batch processing settings
2. Set up monitoring for admin dashboard usage
3. Review audit logs for impersonation activities
4. Configure export limits and security settings

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Access Control
