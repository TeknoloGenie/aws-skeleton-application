All 3 of those will have there own set of rules. The Task and QA Finding workflows will use the Discussion workflow prior to beginning work on the task. A Discussion workflow will review all related files and tests. If its a Task you will ask if its a frontend or backend task, what the title is, what the description is, what component or service files are we working on. If none are provided use your best judgement. If its a QA Finding you will ask how to replicate the issue within the UI if its frontend or if backend ask for a sample of data we are passing to the backend api. If its a Task or QA finding you will update or create tests, prior to creating tests you MUST provide a list of ones you will update or suggested test cases."
