## ðŸ”§ Rule System Features

### Versioning Rules (Enhanced)
- **Strict Enforcement**: Clear forbidden actions until "This task is complete" phrase
- **Explicit Blocking**: Cannot create tests, update versions, generate changelogs, or commit
- **Required Phrase**: Must wait for exact phrase "This task is complete"
- **Sequential Workflow**: Test â†’ Version â†’ Changelog â†’ Commit with approval

### Rule Update Rules (New)
- **Preview Changes**: Must show current vs. proposed content before implementation
- **Mandatory Approval**: Cannot update rule files without explicit user permission
- **Clear Format**: Structured presentation of additions, modifications, and removals
- **Comprehensive Scope**: Applies to all files in .amazonq/rules/ directory

### Package Installation Rules (New)
- **Pre-approval Required**: Must request permission before installing any package

- **No Assumptions**: Cannot install packages even if they seem obviously needed
- **Complete Coverage**: Applies to all package types and managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)

### Task Planning Rules (New)

- **Approval Confirmation**: User maintains control over all modifications

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Examples

### Task Planning Example
```
User: "Add delete functionality"
Assistant: 
- TASK ANALYSIS: Scope, components, complexity
- VERSION CLASSIFICATION: Minor feature addition
- RELATED FEATURES: User model, relationships, cascade effects
- PROPOSED PLAN: Step-by-step implementation approach
- RISKS: Data loss, session cleanup, reversibility
- Wait for approval before proceeding
```

### Package Installation Example
```
Assistant: "Need to install @testing-library/react for testing
