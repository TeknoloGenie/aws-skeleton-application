I now have a complete understanding of what we were working on. Here's my summary:\n\n## Task Understanding\n\nWe were building a comprehensive **Admin Dashboard System** for the AWS Application Accelerator Framework with the following key components:\n\n### üéØ **Core Implementation Completed:**\n\n1. **Cross-Platform Admin Dashboards** - Created complete admin interfaces for Vue, React, and Angular\n2. **Analytics System** - Built comprehensive tracking with batch processing and encryption\n3. **Security & Access Control** - Established admin-only access with Cognito groups\n4. **Model Management Rules** - Created mandatory processes for consistency\n\n### üìÅ **Current Git State:**\n- Modified routing files (adding admin routes and guards)\n- Many new untracked files (admin components, services, rules)\n- Analytics processor Lambda function\n- Log model and SystemSettings seed data\n- Component migration scripts\n\nThe implementation looks complete and ready for testing, validation, or any improvements you'd like to make.\n\nWhat would you like to focus on next with this admin dashboard system?"

Admin route access control (admins group requirement)\n2. Analytics service functionality (tracking, batching, encryption)\n3. Admin dashboard component loading and basic functionality\n4. Model management consistency across platforms\n\nShould I proceed with creating these integration tests to validate the admin dashboard system implementation?"
